# Workload Management System Implementation

## Overview
I have successfully implemented a comprehensive workload management system for teachers/staff that includes both backend API and database models. This system allows for tracking, managing, and analyzing teacher workloads with detailed reporting capabilities.

## Backend Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

### Database Models (Prisma Schema)
The following models have been added to the database:

1. **TeacherWorkload** - Main workload record per teacher per academic year
2. **MonthlyWorkload** - Monthly breakdown of hours
3. **QuarterlyWorkload** - Quarterly breakdown of hours  
4. **DailyWorkload** - Daily hour tracking with types (regular, overtime, sick, vacation)
5. **SubjectWorkload** - Subject-specific hour allocation
6. **AdditionalActivity** - Extra activities and responsibilities

### API Endpoints
- `GET /workload` - List all workloads with pagination and filtering
- `POST /workload` - Create new teacher workload
- `GET /workload/:id` - Get specific workload details
- `PATCH /workload/:id` - Update workload
- `DELETE /workload/:id` - Delete workload
- `GET /workload/teacher/:teacherId` - Get workloads by teacher
- `POST /workload/:id/daily-hours` - Add daily hours
- `GET /workload/analytics` - Get analytics and statistics

### Features Implemented
- Full CRUD operations for workload management
- Hierarchical time tracking (yearly → quarterly → monthly → daily)
- Multiple workload types (regular, overtime, sick leave, vacation)
- Subject-specific workload allocation
- Additional activities tracking
- Comprehensive analytics and reporting
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Pagination support

## Frontend Implementation ❌ PENDING

### What needs to be created:

1. **Types/Interfaces** (`apps/frontend/src/types/workload.ts`)
   - TypeScript interfaces for all workload-related data structures
   - API response types
   - Form data types

2. **Service Layer** (`apps/frontend/src/services/workloadService.ts`)
   - API communication functions
   - Data fetching and mutation functions
   - Error handling

3. **Hooks** (`apps/frontend/src/hooks/useWorkload.ts`)
   - Custom React hooks for workload data management
   - State management with React Query/SWR
   - Loading and error states

4. **Components**
   - `WorkloadForm` - Create/edit workload records
   - `WorkloadTable` - Display workloads in table format
   - `WorkloadChart` - Visual representation of workload data
   - `DailyHoursModal` - Add daily hours tracking
   - `WorkloadAnalytics` - Dashboard with charts and statistics

5. **Pages**
   - `TeacherWorkload` - Main workload management page
   - `WorkloadDetail` - Detailed view of specific workload
   - `WorkloadAnalytics` - Analytics and reporting page

6. **Navigation Integration**
   - Add routes to the router
   - Update sidebar navigation
   - Add permissions/role-based access

## Database Migration

The database schema has been updated with a migration file:
```
apps/backend/prisma/migrations/20250122_add_workload_models/migration.sql
```

To apply the migration, run:
```bash
cd apps/backend
npx prisma migrate dev
```

## Key Features Available

### Workload Tracking
- Annual, quarterly, monthly, and daily hour tracking
- Multiple workload types (regular, overtime, sick, vacation)
- Subject-specific hour allocation
- Additional activities and responsibilities

### Analytics & Reporting
- Teacher workload distribution analysis
- Subject workload analysis
- Trend analysis over time periods
- Overload/underload identification
- Summary statistics

### Data Management
- Search and filter workloads
- Pagination for large datasets
- Bulk operations support
- Data validation and error handling

## Next Steps

1. **Generate Prisma Client**: Run `npx prisma generate` to update the Prisma client
2. **Apply Migration**: Run the database migration to create the new tables
3. **Frontend Implementation**: Create the frontend components and pages
4. **Testing**: Implement unit and integration tests
5. **Documentation**: Create user documentation and API docs

## Integration Points

The workload system integrates with:
- **Teachers Module**: Links to teacher records
- **StudyPlans Module**: Associates subjects with study plans
- **Schedule Module**: Can reference schedule data for validation
- **Reports Module**: Provides data for comprehensive reporting

## Technical Considerations

- All API endpoints include proper validation and error handling
- Database relationships ensure data integrity
- Pagination and filtering optimize performance
- Analytics calculations are optimized for large datasets
- The system is designed to scale with growing data volumes

This workload management system provides a solid foundation for tracking and managing teacher workloads with comprehensive analytics and reporting capabilities.
